Your legs may feel weak or numb or cramp when you walk. They might feel cold and be an odd color. Some people can manage PAD with habit changes, like quitting smoking. If that doesn’t work, your doctor might give you medicine to treat the problem or help with pain. But some people need surgery.',\n",
       " 'This is a blood clot in a vein, usually in your thigh or lower leg. It doesn’t always cause symptoms, but you might have pain, swelling in your leg, and it might be warm and red. Call your doctor right away if you notice any of these. DVT can lead to a serious condition called a pulmonary embolism -- when the clot breaks off and goes to your lungs. Your doctor can give you medicine to keep clots from forming, growing, or breaking off.',\n",
       " 'This happens when there’s damage to the nerves in your body that relay messages to and from your brain. The most common cause is diabetes, but other health conditions, medicines, injuries, or infections can cause it. If it affects the nerves in your legs, they might feel prickly or tingly, or they might be numb or weak. Your doctor will treat the condition that’s causing it and give you medicine for pain if you need it.',\n",
       " 'Electrolytes are minerals like sodium, potassium, and calcium that help your muscles work the way they should. You lose some through sweat when you exercise, and if you lose too much, your legs can cramp or feel weak or numb. It can happen when you get some medical treatments, like chemotherapy, too. Sports drinks with electrolytes -- or water along with foods that have those minerals -- can help. See your doctor if you cramp up often.',\n",
       " 'This condition happens when the spaces within the bones in your spine get narrow. That puts pressure on the nerves in the area and can cause pain, tingling, numbness, or weakness in your legs. You also might have trouble with balance. See your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms. Medication can ease the pain, and physical therapy can help, too. If these don’t work, you might need surgery.',\n",
       " 'This is leg pain that comes from a pinched nerve in your lower spine. It can range from a bad cramp to a strong shooting pain that makes it hard to stand or even sit. You might feel it because of a slipped or herniated disk, a slipped vertebra, a spasm of your butt muscles, or spinal stenosis. Your doctor might recommend over-the-counter pain meds or physical therapy. If you have a more serious case, you might need surgery.',\n",
       " 'This is a common condition that affects your joints and causes pain, swelling, and stiffness. When it happens in your hips, knees, or ankles, it can be hard to walk or do other everyday activities. There’s no cure, but it can help to exercise and stay at a healthy weight. Heating pads or ice packs on the aching joints can ease pain and swelling. So can over-the-counter pain relievers.',\n",
       " 'This is when a muscle gets stretched too far. It happens a lot to people who play sports. The pain is intense and starts right away, and the area is tender to the touch. The best treatment is to ice it with cold packs for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Outside of that, wrap the area lightly, keep it raised if you can, and rest it. Over-the-counter pain relievers can ease the ache.',\n",
       " 'This injury happens when the tissue that connects a bone to a bone, called a ligament, is stretched or torn. Ankle sprains are common. The injured area swells and hurts, and you can’t put weight on it. The best way to treat it is the R.I.C.E. method -- rest, ice (about 20 minutes a few times a day), compression (wrap it in a bandage), and elevation (prop it up). See your doctor so she can take an X-ray and check for broken bones.',\n",
       " 'This is when a muscle, usually in your calf, suddenly gets tight. It can bring on a sharp pain, and you may feel a hard lump of muscle under your skin. Cramps tend to happen more as you age, and you’re also likely to have them if you’re out in hot weather and don’t drink enough water. Cramps usually go away on their own and aren’t typically a sign of any health issue, but talk with your doctor if you have them often.',\n",
       " 'These happen when the muscles and tissues around your shinbone get inflamed, making the inner edge of the bone hurt. They’re common among people who run a lot. Flat feet, rigid arches, or the wrong shoes can lead to them, too. The best treatment is to rest your legs, put cold packs on them for 20 minutes several times a day, and take pain relievers if you need them. But see your doctor so she can make sure it’s nothing more serious.',\n",
       " \"If pain that feels like shin splints doesn’t get better, you may have a small crack in your shinbone. It happens when the muscles around the bone are overused and don’t cushion the impact of movement the way they should. Rest is the best treatment for a stress fracture, but it can take about 6 to 8 weeks to heal. Make sure it’s healed completely before you start exercising again so you don't make the bone injury worse.\",\n",
       " 'Tendons are the flexible cords that connect muscles to bones. It can hurt a lot if they get inflamed, especially when you move that joint. This is called tendinitis, and it’s a wear-and-tear injury that can affect your hip, knee, or ankle. As with a sprain, the best way to treat it is the R.I.C.E. method. And see your doctor so she can rule out other issues. She also may suggest anti-inflammatory pain meds like ibuprofen or naproxen.',\n",
       " 'When veins have to work extra hard to get blood back to your heart, they bulge and look twisted, blue, or dark purple. They can make your legs feel heavy, burn, throb, or cramp. You’re more likely to have them as you age, or if you’re overweight, pregnant, or stand or sit for long stretches. Losing weight, exercising, or wearing compression stockings may help. If they don’t, talk with your doctor about other treatment options.',\n",
       " 'Meralgia paresthetica is a nerve problem that causes painful burning, numbing, or tingling in your upper thigh. Your chances of having it are higher if you’re pregnant, overweight, wear tight clothes, or have surgical scar tissue in your groin area. You can ease the symptoms with over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. If the pain lasts more than 2 months, your doctor might recommend stronger prescription medicine.',\n",

This sudden, tight, intense lower leg pain is sometimes called a \"charley horse.\" When it takes a grip, it can get worse quickly. It happens when your muscles are tired or dehydrated. Drink more water if you\\'re prone to leg cramps.',\n",
       " 'It might help to gently stretch or massage the area where your muscle has tensed up. Stretch your legs properly before you exercise, too.',\n",
       " 'Shin splints. You can feel this pain right up the front of your calf. The muscles and flesh along the edge of the shin bone become inflamed, so it hurts to walk, run, or jump. Doing activity over and over on hard surfaces can bring this on. You may also be more likely to get shin splints if you have flat feet or your feet turn outward.',\n",
       " 'Rest your legs to feel better. Ice helps. So can anti-inflammatory meds such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, if your doctor says these are safe for you. You can buy them over the counter.',\n",

It’s a common injury that makes the tendon swell, stretch, or tear. You can get it from overworking the calf muscle or climbing the stairs. It might stick around for a long time, too.',\n",

Characteristics, symptoms, and signs of in cold agglutinin disease are premature destruction of red blood cells in the body’s natural defense antibodies. The lifespan of red blood cells is approximately 120 before the spleen destroys the antibodies. In cold agglutinin disease, the severity of the condition is determined by how long it takes for the red blood cells to survive, and at the rate that the bone marrow continues to produce more red cells. Immune hemolytic anemias are classified by the optimal temperature when the antibodies try to destroy red blood cells. Cold agglutinin anemia occurs at temperatures between 10 C (50 F) and 37 C (F 98.6) or above while the body warms antibody hemolytic anemia. Usually, cold agglutinin anemia becomes apparent between the ages of 50 to 60. Other symptoms of the disease include fatigue, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), fingers and/or toes are cold and sweat, an uneven bluish or reddish discoloration of the toes, ankles, and wrists (Raynaud's syndrome), and fingers.Usually, cold agglutinin anemia affects people that are older. The disease is diagnosed by a physical exam, and the Coomb's test. If the red blood cells destruction seem to be slowing on its own, treatment therapies, usually, isn’t needed. Other treatments for cold agglutinin anemia are corticosteroids, and splenectomy (removal of the spleen). There is no cure for cold agglutinin disease.\",\n",

       " \"When walking is supposed to be good for you, why do you have to suffer with leg pains? And what causes the pain in your legs when walking? Fitness experts used to stress the benefits of heavy-duty aerobic exercise — the kind that makes you breathe hard and gets your heart going. But the message changed to moderation after a number of studies showed that physical activity that's far less taxing is associated with lower rates of heart disease, some cancers, and several other illnesses — if it's done regularly. Plain old walking usually tops the moderate-intensity exercise list because it's easy, convenient, and free, and it requires minimal equipment — a comfortable pair of shoes.\",\n",
       " 'The trouble is that walking isn\\'t so easy for everyone. Indeed, the leg pain is agony for many. And forget the \"brisk\" pace of three to four miles per hour advised for health and fitness.',\n",
       " \"With age — and occasionally without it — a number of conditions can result in leg pain after walking and make walking difficult. Some are very familiar, such as arthritis that makes knees and hips creaky; others, such as peripheral artery disease, aren't.\",\n",
       " 'This article looks at four nonarthritic conditions that cause leg pain and may affect walking, and some ways to treat and manage them — no need to limp and bear it!',\n",
       " \"We're discussing these conditions that may cause leg pain separately, but people may have two or more of them at the same time, which complicates diagnosis and treatment.\",\n",
       " 'Peripheral artery disease is a form of atherosclerosis, the same condition that leads to most strokes and heart attacks. Fat- and cholesterol-filled plaque narrows arteries, and blood clots can collect on the plaque, narrowing them further. In peripheral artery disease, the arteries affected by atherosclerosis tend to be the ones that supply the leg muscles. The risk factors are similar to those for heart disease and stroke: smoking, high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, and especially diabetes.',\n",
       " 'The classic symptom is cramping, tight pain that\\'s felt in muscles \"downstream\" from the narrowed artery. It can occur in the buttocks, thigh, calf, or foot, but occurs most often in the calf. The pain tends to come on with walking, gets worse until the person stops walking, and goes away with rest. Similar to angina, the pain caused by peripheral artery disease comes from working muscle cells that are \"starved\" for oxygen because of obstructed blood flow. The medical jargon for this kind of pain is intermittent claudication, from the Latin claudicatio for limping. Many people with peripheral artery disease have other sorts of pain, though. Sometimes their legs are heavy, or they tire easily. And it\\'s common for people to cut back on their activity level without realizing it, which can mask the problem.',\n",
       " \"Signs of peripheral artery disease include a diminished pulse below the narrowed artery, scratches and bruises in the lower leg that won't heal, and pale and cool skin. The diagnosis usually depends on the ankle-brachial index, which compares the blood pressure at the ankle to the blood pressure at the arm. They're normally about the same, but if there's a blockage in the leg, blood pressure will be lower in the ankle because of low blood flow.\",\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Arteries narrowed by atherosclerosis leave leg muscles starved for oxygen.',\n",
       " \"Peripheral artery disease by itself can be serious and debilitating, but it may also serve as an important warning of even more serious trouble. Atherosclerosis in the legs often means there's atherosclerosis elsewhere, and people with peripheral artery disease are six to seven times more likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or transient ischemic attack than people without it. A peripheral artery disease diagnosis should prompt a concerted effort to rein in cardiovascular disease risk factors.\",\n",
       " 'Walking hurts, so a \"just do it\" attitude about exercise isn\\'t helpful. But researchers have found that tightly structured, supervised exercise programs can help people increase the amount they can walk before their leg pain kicks in. These programs usually involve walking \\'til it hurts (which may be only for a few minutes), resting \\'til the pain goes away, and then walking again. These walk-rest-walk sessions are most effective if people do them for about 30 minutes at least several days a week.',\n",
       " 'Low dose aspirin (75 mg to 81 mg) is often recommended to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. Clopidogrel (Plavix), another drug that makes blood clots less likely by making platelets less sticky, is an alternative for people with aspirin allergy. Cilostazol (Pletal) can help people walk longer distances without pain.',\n",
       " 'Serious cases of peripheral artery disease can cause leg pain even when the person isn\\'t walking. This \"rest pain\" most often occurs in the feet. Even more serious are cases when the condition leads to tissue death and gangrene.',\n",
       " \"If peripheral artery disease is serious, or isn't improving with exercise and medication, doctors can reopen the blocked artery with angioplasty or use part of a blood vessel from elsewhere in the body to reroute circulation around the blockage. But the track record of these revascularization procedures is mixed, and some studies suggest that the results from a structured exercise program can be as good, or even better.\",\n",
       " \"Like peripheral artery disease, chronic venous insufficiency is a condition of poor circulation, but it involves the veins and the blood's return trip back to the heart and lungs.\",\n",
       " 'Our arteries are springy and help push blood along, but our veins are relatively passive participants in circulation. Particularly in the legs, it\\'s the muscles surrounding the veins that provide the pumping power that drains the vessels near the surface of the skin and then push the blood up through the \"deeper\" vessels that travel toward the heart. Tiny valves inside the veins even out the pressure and keep the blood from flowing backward.',\n",
       " 'In people with chronic venous insufficiency, the valves are damaged, so blood tends to pool in the legs and feet instead of traveling \"north\" to the heart. It\\'s often a vicious cycle: if the valves aren\\'t working, pressure from the blood collecting in the veins increases, so the veins stretch out. As a result, the valves don\\'t close properly, so even more blood flows backward, adding pressure.',\n",
       " 'Symptoms include swelling, inflammation of the skin (dermatitis) and the connective tissue underneath (cellulitis), and ulcerated, open wounds on the bony \"bumps\" of the ankle. Legs may feel achy or heavy. And when people walk, they may feel a tight, \"bursting\" pain, most often in the groin or thigh. The leg pain will stop with rest but may take longer to ease up than the pain from peripheral artery disease.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Damaged valves in veins means blood may flow backward and accumulate in veins.',\n",
       " \"The symptoms from a mild case of chronic venous insufficiency can be helped by lying on your back and using a pillow to elevate your legs so blood flows downhill to the heart. If you're sitting for long periods, pointing your toes up and down several times can flex the vein-pumping leg muscles.\",\n",
       " 'More serious cases needed to be treated with compression stockings that squeeze harder at the ankle than at the knee. For the stockings to work, they must be much tighter than the \"antiembolism\" stockings people routinely wear in the hospital. But because they are so tight, people often have a hard time getting them on. Washing a new pair can help. Some people coat their skin with talcum powder or wear thin, regular stockings underneath. Devices called \"wire donners\" hold the stockings open so people can push a foot and leg into it.',\n",
       " 'There are no specific medicines to treat venous insufficiency. Surgical procedures have improved significantly over the years. Nowadays varicose vein therapy has moved very far away from the old-fashioned saphenous vein stripping. That procedure involved making an incision in the groin and leg, inserting a stripping device into the vein, and pulling the vein out of the body. It usually required general anesthesia, an overnight hospital stay and weeks of recovery.',\n",
       " 'Today, physicians usually close the vein permanently rather than remove it. They use one of several minimally invasive techniques, performed through catheters inserted into the veins under ultrasound guidance. These treatments are performed in outpatient settings under local anesthesia, and the patient can walk immediately after treatment.',\n",
       " 'Stenosis (pronounced ste-NO-sis) is a medical term for any kind of narrowing. Spinal stenosis can occur anywhere along the spine as a result of the vertebrae, the disks between them, or their supporting structures impinging on the tube-like spinal canal that holds the spinal cord and the roots of the nerves that branch off of it. Pain comes from the mechanical pressure, and perhaps also from the pinching off of blood flow to nerves.',\n",
       " \"The lumbar region of the spine consists of the five large vertebrae that form the small of the back. When spinal stenosis occurs in the lumbar region, lower back pain can be a symptom but often it's the legs that are affected. The pain can resemble the pain caused by peripheral artery disease: cramping tightness that increases with walking, although it's often felt in the thigh rather than the calf. The legs may also feel weak and numb.\",\n",
       " \"In the past, the leg pain caused by lumbar stenosis was called pseudoclaudication because it was unrelated to blocked arteries, and doctors didn't understand that it could be caused by spinal problems. Now the preferred medical term seems to be neurogenic (which means originating from the nervous system) claudication.\",\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Vertebrae, disks, and other parts of the spine impinge on the spinal cord and nerves branching off of it.',\n",
       " \"The diagnosis starts with discussion of symptoms and medical history. One important clue is whether the pain eases when the back is curved forward, or flexed. That posture tends to take pressure off the lumbar region, and it's the reason some people with lumbar spinal stenosis find it easier to walk when leaning on a grocery cart or a walker.\",\n",
       " \"An MRI or CT scan will often be ordered to confirm a diagnosis, but imaging studies shouldn't be used to make one. Many people have spinal stenosis that shows up on an imaging study but doesn't cause any symptoms.\",\n",
       " 'Treatment usually begins with physical therapy and exercises aimed at strengthening back and abdominal muscles. Pain relievers may help. Growing numbers of older patients are getting corticosteroid injections into the spine, which worries some experts. Evidence that the shots are effective is mixed.',\n",
       " 'If the pain persists, surgery is an option. The most common procedure is a laminectomy, which involves cutting away part of a vertebra to create more space for the spinal cord and nerves. Bone spurs and portions of the disks and facet joints can also be removed to relieve pressure. Study results for surgery are murky. The majority of patients seem to feel better for the first year or so, but the advantage over a nonsurgical approach seems to wear off after several years. A second operation is sometimes needed. On the other hand, for some, surgery greatly reduces the pain and discomfort.',\n",
       " 'People with diabetes are prone to nerve damage, or neuropathy. Exactly why is uncertain. High blood sugar levels may damage the tiny blood vessels that supply nerves, creating \"nerve strokes\": nerves starved for oxygen (ischemic) because of damaged vessels. Diabetes may also deplete the body\\'s store of neurotrophic peptides, chemicals that normally repair and regenerate nervous tissue.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'Blood vessels (shown in red) that supply nerve cells can be damaged by high blood sugar.',\n",
       " 'Diabetic neuropathy affects the upper and lower legs in different ways. In the upper leg, the pain from ischemic nerves can come on suddenly and be felt in just one leg. In the lower legs and feet, where it is more common, the symptoms are typically numbness or tingling, and are usually felt about equally in both legs. The numbness often dulls painful sensations, so sores on the feet go unnoticed and get worse. Diabetic neuropathy can make walking difficult, but leg pain may improve with exercise.',\n",
       " \"People with diabetes can reduce their chances of developing neuropathy by keeping their blood sugar down. It's less certain that tight blood sugar control is helpful once nerves have been damaged. Still, it's an important goal for many other reasons. Pain relievers, tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, desipramine, duloxetine), and anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin) are used to control the burning and tingling sensations from neuropathy.\",\n",

       " 'With this condition, your limbs -- typically your legs -- don’t get enough blood. It usually happens because your arteries have narrowed. Your legs may feel weak or numb or cramp when you walk. They might feel cold and be an odd color. Some people can manage PAD with habit changes, like quitting smoking. If that doesn’t work, your doctor might give you medicine to treat the problem or help with pain. But some people need surgery.',\n",
       " 'This is a blood clot in a vein, usually in your thigh or lower leg. It doesn’t always cause symptoms, but you might have pain, swelling in your leg, and it might be warm and red. Call your doctor right away if you notice any of these. DVT can lead to a serious condition called a pulmonary embolism -- when the clot breaks off and goes to your lungs. Your doctor can give you medicine to keep clots from forming, growing, or breaking off.',\n",
       " 'This happens when there’s damage to the nerves in your body that relay messages to and from your brain. The most common cause is diabetes, but other health conditions, medicines, injuries, or infections can cause it. If it affects the nerves in your legs, they might feel prickly or tingly, or they might be numb or weak. Your doctor will treat the condition that’s causing it and give you medicine for pain if you need it.',\n",
       " 'Electrolytes are minerals like sodium, potassium, and calcium that help your muscles work the way they should. You lose some through sweat when you exercise, and if you lose too much, your legs can cramp or feel weak or numb. It can happen when you get some medical treatments, like chemotherapy, too. Sports drinks with electrolytes -- or water along with foods that have those minerals -- can help. See your doctor if you cramp up often.',\n",
       " 'This condition happens when the spaces within the bones in your spine get narrow. That puts pressure on the nerves in the area and can cause pain, tingling, numbness, or weakness in your legs. You also might have trouble with balance. See your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms. Medication can ease the pain, and physical therapy can help, too. If these don’t work, you might need surgery.',\n",
       " 'This is leg pain that comes from a pinched nerve in your lower spine. It can range from a bad cramp to a strong shooting pain that makes it hard to stand or even sit. You might feel it because of a slipped or herniated disk, a slipped vertebra, a spasm of your butt muscles, or spinal stenosis. Your doctor might recommend over-the-counter pain meds or physical therapy. If you have a more serious case, you might need surgery.',\n",
       " 'This is a common condition that affects your joints and causes pain, swelling, and stiffness. When it happens in your hips, knees, or ankles, it can be hard to walk or do other everyday activities. There’s no cure, but it can help to exercise and stay at a healthy weight. Heating pads or ice packs on the aching joints can ease pain and swelling. So can over-the-counter pain relievers.',\n",
       " 'This is when a muscle gets stretched too far. It happens a lot to people who play sports. The pain is intense and starts right away, and the area is tender to the touch. The best treatment is to ice it with cold packs for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Outside of that, wrap the area lightly, keep it raised if you can, and rest it. Over-the-counter pain relievers can ease the ache.',\n",
       " 'This injury happens when the tissue that connects a bone to a bone, called a ligament, is stretched or torn. Ankle sprains are common. The injured area swells and hurts, and you can’t put weight on it. The best way to treat it is the R.I.C.E. method -- rest, ice (about 20 minutes a few times a day), compression (wrap it in a bandage), and elevation (prop it up). See your doctor so she can take an X-ray and check for broken bones.',\n",
       " 'This is when a muscle, usually in your calf, suddenly gets tight. It can bring on a sharp pain, and you may feel a hard lump of muscle under your skin. Cramps tend to happen more as you age, and you’re also likely to have them if you’re out in hot weather and don’t drink enough water. Cramps usually go away on their own and aren’t typically a sign of any health issue, but talk with your doctor if you have them often.',\n",
       " 'These happen when the muscles and tissues around your shinbone get inflamed, making the inner edge of the bone hurt. They’re common among people who run a lot. Flat feet, rigid arches, or the wrong shoes can lead to them, too. The best treatment is to rest your legs, put cold packs on them for 20 minutes several times a day, and take pain relievers if you need them. But see your doctor so she can make sure it’s nothing more serious.',\n",
       " \"If pain that feels like shin splints doesn’t get better, you may have a small crack in your shinbone. It happens when the muscles around the bone are overused and don’t cushion the impact of movement the way they should. Rest is the best treatment for a stress fracture, but it can take about 6 to 8 weeks to heal. Make sure it’s healed completely before you start exercising again so you don't make the bone injury worse.\",\n",
       " 'Tendons are the flexible cords that connect muscles to bones. It can hurt a lot if they get inflamed, especially when you move that joint. This is called tendinitis, and it’s a wear-and-tear injury that can affect your hip, knee, or ankle. As with a sprain, the best way to treat it is the R.I.C.E. method. And see your doctor so she can rule out other issues. She also may suggest anti-inflammatory pain meds like ibuprofen or naproxen.',\n",
       " 'When veins have to work extra hard to get blood back to your heart, they bulge and look twisted, blue, or dark purple. They can make your legs feel heavy, burn, throb, or cramp. You’re more likely to have them as you age, or if you’re overweight, pregnant, or stand or sit for long stretches. Losing weight, exercising, or wearing compression stockings may help. If they don’t, talk with your doctor about other treatment options.',\n",
       " 'Meralgia paresthetica is a nerve problem that causes painful burning, numbing, or tingling in your upper thigh. Your chances of having it are higher if you’re pregnant, overweight, wear tight clothes, or have surgical scar tissue in your groin area. You can ease the symptoms with over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. If the pain lasts more than 2 months, your doctor might recommend stronger prescription medicine.',\n",

       " 'Pain or discomfort anywhere in the leg can range from a dull ache to an intense stabbing sensation. Most leg pain occurs due to overuse or minor injuries. The discomfort often disappears within a short time and can be eased with home remedies. ',\n",
       " 'In some cases, however, a serious medical condition may be causing the pain. See your doctor if you’re experiencing severe or persistent leg pain. Getting a prompt diagnosis and treatment for any underlying conditions may prevent the pain from getting worse and improve your long-term outlook. ',\n",
       " 'Some of the more common causes of leg pain are minor or temporary conditions that your doctor can treat effectively. ',\n",
       " 'A primary cause of leg pain is a muscle cramp or spasm that’s often known as “a charley horse.” A cramp usually triggers sudden, sharp pain as the leg muscles contract. The tightening muscles often form a visible, hard lump beneath the skin. There may be some redness and swelling in the surrounding area.',\n",
       " 'Muscle fatigue and dehydration may lead to leg cramps, especially in the calf. Certain medications, including diuretics and statins, may also cause leg cramps in some people. ',\n",

       " 'The following conditions and injuries can also lead to leg pain, but they’re less common causes: ',\n",
       " 'You can usually treat leg pain at home if it’s due to cramps or a minor injury. Try the following home treatments when your leg pain is from muscle cramps, fatigue, or overuse: ',\n",
       " 'Apply ice to the affected area of your leg at least four times per day. You can do this even more frequently in the first few days after the pain appears. You can leave the ice on for as long as 15 minutes at a time.',\n",
       " 'Take a warm bath, and then gently stretch your muscles. If you have pain in the lower part of your leg, try pointing and straightening your toes when sitting or standing. If you have pain in the upper part of your leg, try to bend over and touch your toes. ',\n",
       " 'You can do this while sitting on the ground or standing up. Ease into each stretch, holding each position for five to 10 seconds. Stop stretching if your pain gets worse.',\n",

       " 'A number of serious conditions and injuries may cause leg pain. Never ignore leg pain that doesn’t seem to be going away or that’s accompanied by other symptoms. Doing so could be dangerous. See your doctor if you’re concerned about your leg pain.',\n",
       " 'You should always take time to stretch your muscles before and after exercising to prevent leg pain due to physical activity. It’s also helpful to eat foods that are high in potassium, such as bananas and chicken, to help prevent injuries of the leg muscles and tendons.',\n",

       " ' Here are some key points about leg pain. More information is in the main article. ',\n",
       " 'Pain occurs when nerves respond to stimuli such as high levels of pressure, high or low temperatures, and chemicals, which can be released by tissue damage.',\n",
       " 'Leg pain can be sharp, dull, numbing, tingling, burning, radiating, or aching.',\n",
       " 'It can also be acute, meaning sudden and short term, or it can also be chronic and persistent. Severity can be rated on a scale from 1 to 10, or from mild to severe.',\n",
       " 'Injury sustained during a sports game or in an accident is normally acute and traumatic. The person can often identify the cause.',\n",
       " 'Other causes, such as peripheral arterial disease (PAD), tend to build up over time, although the person may be able to pinpoint the onset of pain.',\n",
       " 'Some sports injuries build up over time, such as repetitive strain injuries and stress fractures. Traumatic injuries can also become long-term, or chronic, problems if the individual does not rest or seek treatment.',\n",
       " 'It is important to be aware of what was happening before and around the time that leg pain emerged, as this can help decide when to seek medical treatment.',\n",
       " 'Leg pain can mostly be classified as neurological, musculoskeletal, or vascular, or these can overlap.',\n",
       " 'Musculoskeletal pain: Examples are crepitus, recognized by a popping or cracking sound in the knee, or arthritis, an autoimmune disease that affects the joints in the hip, knee, or ankle. If a muscle, tendon, or ligament is strained, for example, during a fall, any pain will be musculoskeletal.',\n",
       " 'Night cramps, compartment syndrome, and stress fractures are also musculoskeletal problems.',\n",
       " 'Vascular pain: Causes include PAD, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cellulitis, infections, varicose veins, and varicose eczema, where pain is accompanied by discoloration of the skin.',\n",
       " 'Neurological pain: Conditions include restless legs syndrome, in which the legs twitch uncontrollably, neuropathy, or nerve damage, and sciatic nerve pain. Neurological pain can be present even when resting.',\n",
       " 'Here we will look at some of these in more detail.',\n",
       " 'Different causes of leg pain can have similar symptoms. Getting a correct diagnosis increases the chances of receiving appropriate treatment, if necessary. Identifying the symptoms and their onset can help find an appropriate diagnosis.',\n",
       " 'Charley horses are transient episodes of pain that can last for several minutes. The muscle, usually the calf at the back of the lower leg, tightens and goes into spasm.',\n",
       " 'Cramps are more common at night and in older people. An estimated 1 in 3 people aged over 60 years experience night cramps, and 40 percent experience over 3 attacks per week.',\n",
       " 'PAD can cause pain in the leg due to poor circulation. Without treatment, it can be fatal. The key symptom is intermittent claudication.',\n",
       " 'Intermittent claudication causes the blood supply to the leg muscles to become restricted. The resulting lack of oxygen and nutrients causes pain.',\n",
       " 'Claudication involves:',\n",
       " 'The cramps consistently occur after the same walking distances, and they often ease on resting.',\n",
       " 'DVT refers to a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg. It can emerge after spending a long time sitting down, for example, on a long-distance flight.',\n",
       " 'Symptoms include swelling and a hot, painful sensation on one side of the leg. This may only occur when walking or standing up.',\n",
       " 'The clot may dissolve on its own, but if the person experiences dizziness and sudden shortness of breath, or if they cough up blood, emergency attention is needed.',\n",
       " 'These could be signs that DVT has developed into a pulmonary embolism, or a blood clot in the lung.',\n",
       " 'Vascular problems can be serious. Both PAD and DVT can present without symptoms. People whose lifestyle or medical history leaves them prone to vascular problems in the leg should be aware of possible symptoms.',\n",
       " 'Engaging in intense exertion during sports can lead to different types of injury.',\n",
       " 'Jogging and running can create repetitive impact forces that overload muscles and tendons. Shin splints produce severe, localized tenderness in the muscles, and sometimes bone pain commonly felt around the shin bone.',\n",
       " 'The shin pain cannot be explained by an obvious cause such as a fracture.',\n",
       " 'Heavy pressure, for example, from a fall, can lead to fractures. Some fractures are easily and immediately visible, with severe bruising, swelling, and deformation. These normally receive urgent medical attention.',\n",
       " 'Stress fractures are small fractures that can result from repetitive stresses sustained during sports, often when the intensity of activity increases too quickly.',\n",
       " 'There is no single injury, and the fractures are small. The pain may start at an earlier stage during each exercise session, and eventually become present all the time.',\n",
       " 'This produces knee pain during downhill running. It is caused by inflammation of the popliteus tendon, which is important for knee stability.',\n",
       " 'Acute trauma can lead to sprains and strains. A sprain refers to a stretching or tearing. A strain is an injury to the muscles or tendons.',\n",
       " 'Often associated with running, a hamstring strain can lead to acute pain in the rear of the thigh muscle, usually due to a partial tear.',\n",
       " 'Sprains and strains usually develop because of inadequate flexibility training, overstretching, or not warming up before an activity. Continuing to exercise while injured increases the risk.',\n",
       " 'When an injury to the leg results in swelling, dangerous levels of pressure in the muscles can lead to acute or chronic compartment syndrome.',\n",
       " 'This could be due to a fracture or severe bruising.',\n",
       " 'The swelling causes pressure to build up until the blood supply to muscle tissue is cut off, depleting the muscles of oxygen and nourishment. The pain may be unexpectedly severe, considering the injury.',\n",
       " 'In severe cases, early pain may be followed by numbness and paralysis. Permanent muscle damage can result.',\n",
       " 'Sciatica happens when pressure is put on a nerve, often in the spine, leading to pains that run down the leg from the hip to the foot.',\n",
       " 'It can happen when a nerve is “pinched” in a muscle spasm or by a herniated disk.',\n",
       " 'Long-term effects include strain on other parts of the body as the gait changes to compensate for the pain.',\n",
       " 'Ovarian cancer can lead to pain and swelling in the legs.',\n",
       " 'Many cases of leg pain can be resolved at home, without medical intervention.',\n",
       " 'If serious causes of cramps have been ruled out, self-help measures can be appropriate.',\n",

       " 'To prevent cramps:',\n",
       " 'Minor sports injuries, such as leg sprains and strains can be treated with RICE:',\n",
